# Voice-Signal-Processing
This repository contains a Python script for processing a voice signal using Fourier transform techniques. The script reads an audio file, applies a low-pass filter by zeroing out small Fourier coefficients, and saves the processed signal. Additionally, it provides a visualization of the original, processed, and difference signals.
